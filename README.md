## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used the video and instructions provided on the prework site.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I would say my biggest challenge creating my submission is my lack of experience with JavaScript and HTML. Before starting this project, I have never used JavaScript in any of the projects I have worked on in the past. I am only familiar with C and C++ because I often use them in my classes. I have a little bit of experience with CSS which helped me in some parts of the project. I would say that learning JavaScript while creating my prework was the challenge I had to overcome. In my opinion I could have added more features in my work if I had more background knowledge on JavaScript. However, I think my lack of experience in this language enabled me to be more creative. Hardly having any knowledge in CSS AND HTML, I had to do trial and error in my code to see what features I can add to make it original. I was able to make a couple of features work by using the sources that was given to me in the prework site. I tried to look up how to add more features online but unfortunately, I do not have enough time to add it to my project. This project took me a little longer than I expected because I did not see the step-by-step instructions when I first started the project. Overall, this project looked easy but it definitely challenged me and taught me new experiences.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing this project, I am curious to what other language is used in web development? Is JavaScript, HTML, and CSS the three key components to web development? I also am interested in knowing what kind of classes a college student can take to learn more about web developing. Can I self-teach most of the knowledge needed to be a web developer? I am curious what else I need to learn to be able to do complex projects in web development because making this simple game was quite interesting. I am interested in knowing more about this topic and would like to learn more.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After finishing the basic functions for the simple memory game, I wanted to make my project more original. I reached out to a fellow computer science student and asked what would make my game more interesting. She suggested background music. I then remember the Kahoot games I used to participate in high school. I remember it having background music while the players are playing. Therefore, if I had a few more hours making this project I would have added background music. I would have it so that the game would have the music playing until the user press the start button. When the game starts the background music stops since the user needs to listen to the sounds the buttons make. Then when they win or lose, I would add audio in the end that says, “Congratulations you won” or “You lost, try again”.  I also wanted to add a volume button where the user can adjust the volume to their liking. This would help some user who has hearing issues. I wanted to input this in my project, but I encountered a few problems which I did not have the solutions to. Therefore, I decided to stick with what I currently have.
